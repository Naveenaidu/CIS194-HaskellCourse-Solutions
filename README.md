# Solutions for CIS 194:Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013)

An attempt at converting my Love-Hate relationship with Haskell to a competely blissful 
relationship :P

I'll be working through the assignments from the [CIS 194: Spring 2013](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) to get better understanding of my future love.

The following are the resources I'm following along with this course:
1. [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
2. [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/)
3. Programming in Haskell - Graham Hutton
